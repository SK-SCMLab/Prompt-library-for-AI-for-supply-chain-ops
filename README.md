##ðŸ¦‘ Elements of prompt
A prompt's form depends on a task you are giving to a model. As you explore prompt engineering example, you will review prompts containing some or all the following elements:
- *Introduction* provides a task description or instruction for how the model should perform
- *Context* is external information to guide the model
- *Input data* is the input for which you want a response
- *Output indicator* is the output type or format

**Best practices for designing effective prompts**
1. Be clear and concise
2. Include context if needed
3. Use directives for the appropriate response type
4. Consider the output in the prompt
5. Start prompts with an integration
6. Provide an example response
7. Break up complex tasks
8. Experiment and be creative

It is important to review the model's responses to ensure that the prompts are eliciting the appropriate quality, type, and range of responses. Make changes to the prompts if needed. You can even ask one copy of the model to improve or check output from another copy of the model. With experimentation, you will gain intuition for crafting and optimizing prompts to best suit your needs and models. Prompt engineering is an iterative skill and improves with practice
